This dataset contain the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Preparation of the dataset for the analysis is performed with two R scripts.

The first (samdata_analysis_code.R) performs the following tasks:

	1. checks for the presence of the source dataset in the working directory;
	2. downloads and unzips the source file from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website in the working directory if the source dataset doesn't exist;
	3. run the second script.
The second script (run_analysis.R) performs the following tasks:

	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
	5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
